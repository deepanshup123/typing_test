Almost all of the writing one reads in a textbook or an article can be grouped into paragraphs if it is longer than a few sentences."],

    "he first sentence of your paragraph should offer the reader an idea of the type of information they may expect to find when they read the rest. The initial sentences should construct a scenario that will set the tone for the rest of the sentence.  And the rest of the sentence should strive to maintain the same theme.",
    "The essential sentences in the paragraph should be supplemented by the middle sentence. You can use this middle sentence to persuade the reader of the main point you made in the beginning. Expand every detail so the viewers can perceive everything from your point of view.",
    "The last sentences of a paragraph might be used to conclude the main theme of that paragraph. This concluding sentence should provide a summary of the details you supplied. If one wishes to write another paragraph the use transition words like additionally, furthermore, moreover, consequently, similarly etc.",
    "I have a pet dog named Bruno. He is brown and furry. He is named after my mother's favourite singer, Bruno Mars. Bruno came into my life when I was 4 years old. I clearly remember the day when I saw him for the first time. My older brother and I went to the Adoption Centre for Rescued Dogs.",
    "The best part about the colour blue that I feel is safety and protection. I have always seen my mother in blue sarees, it is her favourite colour as well. And even when I step out I feel my mother is with me protecting at every step."
